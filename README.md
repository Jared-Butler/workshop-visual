## Objective for Workshop

- To introduce students to a variety of visually appealing npm packages.
- Simple examples to encourage students to experiment and implement into their future projects.
- Peak curiousity of the power behind exploring and learning npm packages.

## Structure, timing, order

Currently there are 4 visual npm packages that will be introduced to the students along with documentation links and simple code examples. Timing will vary on each example depending on what the students are most curious to learn. <br/>
3 - 4 minutes per example

- Encourage to read from the documentation attached to each example as to show the students that information regarding whatever package they're interested in can be found there. This will encourage students to learn independently.

### Build Together

12 - 13 minutes

- Attached is a TestRun file. Based on the group's interest, the instructor can code an example of one of the simple examples so that students can follow data flow. A simple example is encouraged so that the building process will go at the students pace. Questions are encouraged.

### Questions

2 - 5 minutes

- Open for questions. Answers should be given through the documentation. Clarification of simple code examples or more advanced questions of data flow can be answered at this time.

### Final Thoughts

- The objective is to encourage exploration and experimentation. By showing students small but simple examples of npm packages that can greatly enhance simple apps will lead students to place focus on improving their websites visually as well as help them realize the power that can come from finding useful npm packages.
