1. Create a new component in component Folder with a name that indicates the feature.

2. Once you've created the component and all of it's features, import and add a route in the routes.js for your feature.

3. Go into the SideMenu.js and in the renderDescription function, create a case for the route pathname you created for your component.

4. Everything placed in that case will render when the user is navigated to that pathname.
